# CS Scraper
Here are 3 small modules to scrape some CS sites for items, scraped data is saved in `.json` and `.xlsx` formats in a **Data** folder.
Scraping Steam and Buff163 sites will take a bit, because there are some pages and for Buf163 you should use an active account to scrape and there is a cooldown so you don't get banned. 

### This includes scraping modules for:
1. Buff163 (~30 min)
2. Steam (~30 min)
3. Skinport (~1 min)

### Buff163
To scrape **Buf163** you need to provide some cookies to use your account for scraping!

# Library Requirments
While in main directory, use:
```python
pip install -r req.txt
```
# How to use
Run every module or use them in a more complex way.
